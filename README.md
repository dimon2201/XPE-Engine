# XPE Engine

XPE stands for "eXplicit Play Experience"

## Setup

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmmon01/XPE-Engine.git
```

### 2. Generate

Install CMake GUI application in order to generate project from here https://cmake.org/download/

1. Open CMake GUI application
2. Set project source path
3. Press "Configure" and select Visual Studio version
4. Press "Generate"

### 3. Build

Use Visual Studio or CLion IDE to build project binaries.

### PAY ATTENTION!
If you are building project for the first time or doing clean/build, you need to do steps from "2. Generate" and "3. Build" - TWICE!

If you are using CLion IDE, than you don't need to use CMake GUI application. That's because CLion IDE already has intergrated CMake toolchain for making/building project.
